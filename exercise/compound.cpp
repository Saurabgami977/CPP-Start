// Write a program to calculate the (compound) interest on an initial investment of Â£100 at an annual interest rate of 5% by using a loop structure. Do not derive or use the compound interest formula. The idea is to use a loop structure to add the compound interest to the present balance. You should assume that interest is paid annually and print the balance every year for 10 years.
